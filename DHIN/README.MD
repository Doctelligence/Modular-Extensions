# Welcome to DHIN ðŸš€

DHIN, an extension of the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN), is spearheaded by the Doctelligence organization. We are dedicated to creating a self-sovereign healthcare network that benefits global health through decentralization and innovation.

### What We Do at DHIN:
- ðŸ“Š Build a decentralized healthcare network that prioritizes patient sovereignty.
- ðŸ§¬ Utilize blockchain and federated learning to secure and enhance AI model training.
- ðŸ’¡ Develop a system where patients are rewarded for their data contributions, supporting health insurance funding.

The non-profit arm of Doctelligence focuses on decentralizing health data to improve patient outcomes and expand healthcare access. Our work aligns with the WHOâ€™s [Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240020924) and [Universal Health Coverage](https://www.who.int/europe/health-topics/universal-health-coverage), aiming to make healthcare more accessible and equitable.

DHIN originates from the research presented in the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) papers. These were showcased at the Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence - Future of Decentralization and AI, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024. Explore the papers here:
